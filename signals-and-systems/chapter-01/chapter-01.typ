== (b)

*_Solution._* Periodic. Period $T = 2pi/pi = 2$.

= 1.26

== (c)

*_Solution._* If $x[n]$ is periodic, then the period $N$ must be the smallest positive integer such that

$
  pi/8 (n + N)^2 - pi/8 n^2 = pi/8 (2 n N + N^2) = 2 k pi. quad (k in ZZ)
$

This implies that $16 | (2 n N + N^2)$ for all $n$, which further implies that $N = 8$. Hence $x[n]$ is periodic with period $N = 8$.

== (e)

*_Solution._* Periodic. Period $N = lcm(8, 16, 4) = 16$.
